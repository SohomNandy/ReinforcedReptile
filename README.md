# Training-AI-to-play-Snake
This project marks the remake classic Snake game but instead of a human the game is played by AI(in other words a machine).<br>
This project of mine involves me venturing into some of the basics about Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning. <br>
I employed the Pygame module and Pytorch in Python to make this project come to life.<br>
Tutorial: FreeCodeCamp<br>
The movement of the snake gets better by each and every game which is thoroughly analyzed in the subsequent graph.<br>
<b>Parts of the Project:</b><br>
1. getting familiar with the basics of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.<br>
2. Setting up the environment and implementing the Snake game.<br>
3. Implementing the Agent that controls the game.<br>
4. Implementing the neural network to predict the moves and train it.<br>
